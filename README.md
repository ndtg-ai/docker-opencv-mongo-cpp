# Cpp

A [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) program is a sequence of text files (typically header and source files) that contain declarations. They undergo translation to become an executable program, which is executed when the [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) implementation calls its main function.

# OpenCV

[OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/) (Open Source Computer Vision Library: http://opencv.org) is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. The document describes the so-called [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/) 2.x API, which is essentially a C++ API, as opposed to the C-based [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/) 1.x API (C API is deprecated and not tested with "C" compiler since OpenCV 2.4 releases)
